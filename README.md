# Neural Style in TensorFlow

Hello!
This repo contains a Tensorflow implementation of the neural style paper by Gatys, et al. It was my first time using Tensorflow, so the code is extremely simple and easy to follow (hopefully). A blog post is soon to follow detaling the things I learned in the process of picking up tensorflow along with why this particular paper is so compelling. More detailed instructions on running the code will be provided soon as well.

Best,
Lawrence
